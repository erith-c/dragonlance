Document repository for the Dragonlance D&D 5e campaign.

## Ground Rules

### 1. Don't be an asshole.
We're all a team; no one needs to be adversarial in this game. Whether you are neurodiverse, LGBTQIA+, struggle with mental health, or have suffered some kind of abuse, doesn't matter to me. All are welcome here and discrimination and aggression are not tolerated. If you have a problem with myself or another player, feel free to DM me outside of the game and we can discuss the problem--everyone here has their own issues to contend with, however, and there is no excuse for making another participant feel attacked or ignored.

### 2. It's okay to not be the best. In fact, I encourage it.
I know for some it is incredibly popular to "min-max" characters and take feats that make their character not only optimal, but hard to beat. While some DMs like this challenge, I don't have the time or attention to take hyper-optimization into account. I'm not running a power fantasy campaign. I'm sorry, it's just not who I am, and if that's a problem then this campaign may not be for you. I encourage you to build your character based on organic progression, rather than trying to "maximize" your character's combat potential. This rule ties into some of the house rules, but in essence...I don't care if your character is really good at something--that's totally fine. But if your character starts making my life difficult because you're trying to "be the guy"...that's not okay. Thanks.

### 3. As a DM, I try to be fair.
If I make a ruling that you feel is unfair, or if you have an idea that you think would add to the group's story, feel free to ask me about it. Generally speaking, if you can justify it to me I will be more likely to allow it than if you just say "it's what my character would do." Keep in mind, however, that I reserve the right to veto any suggestion given if it would negatively impact the story or if it would be beyond the realm of possibility.

### 4. As a player, you have veto power over your character.
Your character is your own. When it comes to player interactions and role-play, you have absolute authority over your character. For example, if another player wanted to have your character do something you feel would be out-of-character, you have the authority to say "No, my character wouldn't do that." I may make a suggestion based on the overall narrative or historical precedence, but when it comes to roleplaying your character you, the player, have absolute authority. THIS RULE DOES NOT APPLY TO COMBAT OR SKILL CHECKS, though in line with rule #3, if you can justify your idea, it might be more viable. The only other exception to this rule comes with rule #1--if you try to create a character who is essentially a glorified asshole, I will veto it.

### 5. Romance is okay. Sex and abuse are not.
I am most of the time functionally asexual. Sex is a very uncomfortable topic for me, and I will not allow roleplay of it in my game. Your character can be sexual, but be fairwarned that all such acts will take place off-screen. If you and another player want to roleplay a romance, however--i.e., falling in love, spending time together, backing each other up in battle, etc., that's totally okay. This includes NPCs if so desired. Additionally, many people here have endured abusive behavior in some way or form in their lives--cruelty and abuse will not be tolerated in this campaign, whatsoever, except in the form of the abuser getting their comeuppance.

### 6. I encourage creative ideas and solutions. Murder is not a creative idea or solution.
It's a common enough player style to just "murder hobo" the campaign--kill any NPC or group that seems suspicious or disagreeable. _HOWEVER_, such play style does not lend well to a long-term roleplay or story-driven game. I encourage players to find creative ideas and solutions to problems that present themselves in the campaign--I'm not saying everyone has to be lawful or even good, just that players should plan on finding non-murder related solutions where it makes sense to. If the party doesn't abide by this rule, there will be consequences in the game. For example, if you choose a "lawful good" paladin who seeks out and kills evil on sight, and you see everyone who opposes you as "evil", then you're likely going to run into some pretty steep issues--namely, your alignment, which affects your connection to your deity; law enforcement, karma, and even character revocation are all possible outcomes depending on the severity of offense in violation of this rule. DON'T MURDER HOBO.

### 7. My door is open.
I don't want anyone to think that they cannot reach out if there is a problem or concern in this campaign. If there is content or a player making you uncomfortable, please feel free to DM me about it, and I will happily discuss it with you outside of the game. I believe in making a safe space for players, and while I'm empathic, I'm not a mind reader--so please, if there's an issue, even if it's with something I said or did, tell me. If I'm the problem, I can promise I will do my best to correct the issue, and if another player or specific content is the issue, I will do my best to reach a place where we can all be comfortable.

### 8. I am only the story teller. We all make the story together.
I hope I've communicated by this point that this is something we are all engaged in together. My goal here is to have fun telling a story with you, the players, as the main cast. Of course, I will be planning out a lot of things in advance and there may be times that I have to make determinations based on those story plans...however, that is a world and NPC situation. You all have your own stories about your characters to tell. Together, we will intertwine those stories to create something truly impressive. At least, that's my goal.

## House Rules

### 1. All homebrew or custom content must be approved by me in advance.
This includes feats, spells, anything. I reserve the right to say no, no matter how fun or epic something may be.

_Why this rule exists:_ I've encountered a lot of players who use homebrew specifically to mess with their DM, or another player.

### 2. Every character will get one Miracle per campaign.
These Miracles are fate-altering, doomsday-averting occurrences that change the entire course of destiny itself. They, therefore, should be treated as such by the players and used only as an absolute last resort. These can be used to avert a TPK, grant a last wish, or avert a catastrophe; they cannot, however, be used to "kill off" a boss or negate the consequences of an action. They are a boon, not a spell, and once a character has used their Miracle, they will not get another one. Keep in mind also that pulling on the threads of fate with such force also has consequences, which you may or may not see immediately. You choose when to use it and can make suggestions on what you think might be an appropriate consequence, but the consequence is at my discretion.

_Why this rule exists:_ I've been through TPKs and character deaths early in the campaign before. It sucks. This is an optional way to avoid those from happening.

### 3. Every character must have a definable Flaw that cuts through to their very core.
A Flaw of this nature is not a cosmetic blemish or quirk of personality--it is something integral to the character themself that has shaped how they interact with the world around them. If your character's Flaw is that they are afraid of fire, then being around or using fire will have a consequence on that character. You will determine that character's consequence in conversation with me during session 0.

_Why this rule exists:_ Flaws make character development interesting. They also create some dynamic character interactions that can lead to incredible roleplay, even in goofy campaigns.

### 4. A natural 20 is not an automatic success.
A natural 20 represents the pinnacle of what you can achieve. There will be times--hopefully not often--where you get a natural 20 and you still fail. I will be the judge of when this is the case, but rest assured that it's not a likely occurence by any means. If, however, your level 3 sorcerer decides to summon Cthulhu thinking she can control it...buddy, you've got another thing coming.

_Why this rule exists:_ Some actions have consequences. If you do something to try to derail the campaign, instead of derailing the campaign you're going to have to deal with a consequence. So many DMs have worked hard to carefully craft a story only to have the "natural 20 rule" result in something stupid that throws all that work out the window. This rule exists to keep that from happening. You can't roll persuasion on the darkness and expect it to be your friend, especially if it hates and wants to consume you. Sorry.
#### 4a. In combat, a natural 20 is not an automatic success, but if it hits, it is an automatic crit. Natural 19s are crit chances.

### 5. You can play whatever you want, so long as it's within reason.
I don't care if you want to play an LGBTQIA+ character, a character with mental health issues, neurodiversity, etc. Whatever makes you happy. If you do choose a character with something like this, however, I expect you to roleplay it properly, and not make a joke of it. I may require you to change the way you play it if doing so violates the above rules or harms the way other players experience the story, however. ADHD is not just distractibility, depression is not just being sad, and being bisexual doesn't give you an excuse to pursue whatever you come across relentlessly. These are not Flaws; they are complex real world issues that have real world consequences, and I expect them to be treated with respect.

If you want to portray one of these things, please discuss it with me privately so we can give it proper treatment in the story.

"Within reason" means within the context of the story. You can't play a dragon or an eldritch deity, unless said dragon or deity are rendered to the capability of the rest of the party. Sorry.

_Why this rule exists:_ While I wish it was simply a formality, we've all met those players who make mockeries of things that can trigger others. This rule exists to help ensure that doesn't happen.

### 6. At the end of every session, I will hold a vote for who the best roleplayer was. That player will get a reward. 
It may be an one-use item, a shard of luck, extra gold or even a bit of information. The reward will be determined ahead of time--but everyone together decides the recipient.

_Why this rule exists:_ To encourage roleplay and engagement with the story. We all benefit from players being engaged in what is going on, even if they're not on-screen at the moment and this makes the experience more enjoyable for everyone.

### 7. No metagaming. If your character would know it, you can act on it; otherwise, no.
However, if a party member is fighting a monster below the surface of a lake and is put on death's door--and your character is up on land and has no idea that happened, even if you _as the player_ know it did, you cannot cast a spell to stabilize them--you would need to disengage from your battle, go into the water, and discover it first before being able to act on it. I do understand this is a harsh idea, however this is where Ground Rule #3 is very applicable--if you can justify an action's reasonability, then you might be able to get it.

_Why this rule exists:_ I think I summed it up in the rule itself--but it's to add weight to your decisions.

### 8. In conjunction with House Rule #7, death saving throws are made in private DM with me. 
In the heat of battle, your character may be unaware of what is going on around you and you may need to prioritize defeating the enemy versus helping your teammate, as you won't know how close to death your teammate is.

_Why this rule exists:_ To help with rule #7. If other players are unaware of death saving throws, they are less likely to metagame.

### 9. Played in absentia.
If a player is unable to attend, they can optionally elect a player to play their character for them, including roleplay, skill checks and combat. The elected player may choose to accept or not. If a player is not elected or the elected player refuses, the absent player's character will be minimally controlled by the DM--this means roleplay will be minimal, and the DM will handle skill checks and combat. If more than two players are unable to attend, then the session will be rescheduled.

_Why this rule exists:_ Primarily, it exists to preserve player autonomy with respect to their character, and not to punish the party for the player's absence. For many players, not being able to attend a session can throw the entire party out of wack in their absence. This provides an organic way of having the character present for the story without endangering the party, while allowing the respected player to elect someone they trust to play their character as though they were there in their absence if so chosen.
