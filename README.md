# Dragonlance-Adjacent Campaign

## Ground Rules

The ground rules of this campaign serve the purpose of laying out what is and is not allowed at my "table". I will change ground rules as absolutely necessary--but for the most part, I want these to be a static ruleset that allow this game to be safe and inclusive for everyone involved.

### 1. Ill-natured assholes will not be tolerated.

Let me clarify this--if you watch Critical Role, you will understand what I mean when I say that while you can certainly _play_ an asshole (such as Beauregard from Campaign 2), this does not give you license to treat the other players or their characters poorly for the sole reason of your character being an asshole. Even in Critical Role, Beauregard is perceived as an asshole not because she treats people badly, but rather because she has many issues related to trust and has difficulty being honest and friendly. Note that in the show, she actively works on _not_ being an asshole, which makes those times that she is one stand out and advance the story.

When I say don't be an asshole, I mean that both as a player and as a character you should be striving to treat others with decency. Disagreement is absolutely okay and is a healthy part of good roleplay. Good-natured arguments are also a good way to build character relationships and narrative development. Some people naturally are more close-guarded and protective of who they trust and see as friends, and this can and should be roleplayed when applicable, so long as the players are capable of keeping it in the game. Remember that this is first and foremost a story we are building together, and everyone should feel welcome and safe to be whoever they want to be at this table; if anyone begins to feel targetted or attacked as a player, then the game loses all enjoyment for that player and that is something I wish to prevent from happening as much as possible.

### 2. Subjects of a sensitive nature will not be tolerated.

Although I shouldn't need to say this, most of you are strangers. My aim is to provide a safe space for people to escape and have a few hours of enjoyment. Everyone comes from a diverse background and life history, and things that are no big deal to one player may be triggering to another. A few topics, therefore, will be disallowed for roleplay. This includes, but is not limited to:
- Rape and sexual violence
- Racism
- Real world politics
- Discrimination against or targeting any marginalized group
- Discrimination against or targeting any emotional or mental health differences

Some players may wish to use their own life experiences to enhance a character or wish to explore a particular trait or aspect in roleplay--these are generally okay to do. This rule doesn't exist to say these things don't exist--for example, a player may wish to have her character have been a victim of violence in the past and use that to shape her character's story. This is totally fine, so long as it does not lead to a violation of rule #1. Another player may wish that his character was a contributor to racism and and is on a journey to be a better person--this is also okay. What is not okay is a player choosing to have a character engage in these subjects. Such instances will be, when possible, handled out of game, but if necessary I will stop the play to address the issue.

### 3. Sex will not be depicted on screen.

If you want to romance a character, that is fine. I, however, am most of the time functionally asexual and sex is uncomfortable for me. I won't allow it on screen--but that doesn't mean it can't happen. Inter-player romance is also acceptable, _so long as both players agree and are comfortable_, and may be roleplayed during moments of rest in the campaign--such as camping, for example.

### 4. As a player, you have veto power over your character...

There is nothing more frustrating as a player than having something in mind and having someone overrule that because "their character would" or any such thing. Having your agency removed over your own creation is a crushing experience, and removes all fun from the game. As such, as a player you have near-absolute veto power over your character in roleplay. If another player chooses to engage your character in a way that makes you uncomfortable or is not in line with how you want your character to be handled, you have the right to say no. The only exception comes in rule #5.

Keep in mind, that this is a story being made as a group, and human agency is a thing we must take into account, however. There will be times when a shenanigan occurs and it is often more fun for the sake of the group to play along--for example, if you have an "emo" rogue who is standoffish is suddenly polymorphed into a cat by the party's wizard. As a player, you have the opportunity to role against the polymorph and veto authority over how your character acts as a cat--including being picked up or pet. But you can't say "no, the polymorph doesn't happen" unless you have an in-game reason why the spell wouldn't be able to occur.

### 5. ...as a DM, I have power over the story.

There will be times when the players intend to do something and I will say no. I hope that this is a very rare situation, as the game is so much more fun when we are all on the same page. However, there may be times when, because of the story roleplay determinations are overruled. This will always be addressed with the player in question privately and an agreement will be made outside the game if necessary. The important thing here is to ensure all players are comfortable and having fun--but that doesn't mean that things will always go the way you want.

That said, however, if you have an idea then please ask. I may be more willing to allow something I vetoed if you can provide a decent enough explanation for how and why it's a thing you could do. I may still say no, but it's not in me to strip away agency and creativity for the sake of an iron-clutch on the story I've conceived, because sometimes the best stories are the ones that go off the rails.

But don't expect a natural 20 to seduce the enemy to mean you're in the clear and scot-free, and don't expect a nation to be handed to you just because you can be really convincing. :)

### 6. If you choose murder as a means to solving a problem, expect an appropriate response.

While our Dragonlance-adjacent world is a medieval-based setting and there are certainly times when you can "get away" with something, remember that actions have consequences. You never know who may be watching or what means someone may have to ascertain what happened. This is a game where dead spirits can be raised to find out who killed them, where powerful curses can twist and change the land, where demons and dragons can shapeshift into normal humanoids and where magic can let people talk over thousands of miles. Exercise caution in who you choose to kill. You may not like the result.

### 7. As the DM, my door is _always_ open.

If there is something in the campaign or roleplay that makes you uncomfortable, please let me know. If it makes you feel safer, you can private message me about it, or bring it up in the group. Either way, never feel that you must endure or tolerate something simply because no one else in the group seems to realize there's a problem. I am to make a safe space here, but I'm not omniscient, and I won't always realize there's a problem unless you tell me. I can promise, however, that I will work to correct the issue or help clarify something. Even if the concern is something I said or did, never feel afraid to bring it up to me personally.

## House Rules

### 1. No homebrew or custom content without approval by me.

This includes feats, spells, etc. I reserve the right to say no to anything, no matter how fun or particularly you like it. I also reserve the right to--while consulting with you--modify custom/homebrewed content for fairness.

### 2. Every character will get one Miracle _per campaign_.

A Miracle is an original idea of mine, akin to the wish spell. These Miracles are fate-altering, crisis-averting occurrences that can change the entire course of destiny. Once a Miracle is used, it cannot be regained by the character that used it for the remainder of the campaign, and using a Miracle carries a severe consequence--though what that consequence is may not be readily apparent. Pulling on the threads of fate changes the tapestry of destiny in ways not always noticeable at first.

Miracles do have some parameters in their use. They are a boon from an entity outside of reality, not a spell, and calling on a Miracle _may not work as intended_, though the intent of the Miracle will be achieved.

Some suggested uses of a Miracle include:
- averting a TPK
- granting a last wish
- escaping a catastrophe
- save a party member from the clutches of death

Some things a Miracle will not do:
- kill a boss
- negate the consequences of an ill-advised action
- restore an already spent Miracle
- stop the end of the world

The use of a Miracle is a powerful thing, and will be roleplayed accordingly. Your character will be asked important questions and have a divine experience in the process, after which you will be judged and your worthiness of the Miracle will be determined. Choose wisely when and how you will use your Miracle--you will only get one.

### 3. I like roleplay. Expect to do it.

Now, that doesn't mean you have to get super expressive and deep with your character. It doesn't mean that you have to be an excellent actor. I do, however, want you to try to _be_ your character. If your character gets a new ability, describe how your character uses this ability--especially if it's for the first time! If your character wants to have a conversation with another character, feel free to engage them in it. Have fun!

### 4. A natural 20 is _not_ an automatic success.

A natural 20 represents the pinnacle of what you can achieve. Sometimes, your character simply will not have the capability of the action you wish to perform. There will be times--hopefully not often--where you get a natural 20 and you still fail. That said, rolling a natural 20 is a beautiful and wonderful occurrence and it will still be treated with the value that it deserves. You can't roll diplomacy on the darkness and expect it to be your friend, however.

### 5. I don't really care what you play.

Just don't make it weird, okay? My game isn't the place to live out your kink fantasy. I'm sorry. It's just not something I'm comfortable with. But if you want to play a kenku that only parrots what other people say or you want to play a character that represents a marginalized group, go for it! So long as you don't make anyone at the table (including myself) uncomfortable with your choice, I'm more than happy to allow it, within reason. If you wish to portray a mental health issue, LGBTQIA+ representation, or particular concept and aren't overly familiar with it outside of the game, speak with me privately and we can discuss it.

### 6. At the end of every session, I will hold a vote for who engaged in the best roleplay for that session. That player will get an in-game reward.

This vote will be cast among the players. The reward may be a one-use item, a shard of luck, gold, or even information. This reward will be handed out at the following session.

### 7. No metagaming.

If your character would know it, they can act on it. However, even if you _as the player_ are aware of it, if your character is not then they cannot act on it. It's part of good roleplay.

As a part of this, you as the players can determine if you would like me to roll your death saving throws; this may make it easier for you to roleplay during combat, but it may not--it will be up to the general consensus. Similarly, use descriptive language for your health status, not numbers.

### 8. Played in absentia.

Unless otherwise determined, I--or another player of your choice--can play your character for you should you need to be absent from a session. If you can't attend and would like your character played, message me on Discord with a screenshot of your characters stats and abilities and who you would like to have play your character. If you don't list anyone, I'll assume its me.

If you choose not to elect this option, that's okay; if your character is present with the party they will simply not engage in roleplay or combat--but it's there if you want it.

### 9. XP

We're doing story-based leveling and point-buy. You will all level at story milestones--this way, no characters are left behind if they are unable to participate. The point buy rules are as follows:

No stat can go below 6, and no stat can go above 17 pre-racial changes. All stats start at 9. You have 24 points to spend. All other normal rules apply.
